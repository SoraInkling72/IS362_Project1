The sample size between the two airlines are non-proportional to one another, especially since America West Airlines (**AM WEST**) has a larger sample size compared to Alaska Airlines (**ALASKA**). Thus, I need to calculate the ratio of number of both on-time and delayed arrivals to the total number of arrivals of each airline. But first, the sum of the total number of arrivals for each airline must be calculated, giving the observational sample size of both airlines. Afterwards, I can calculate the on-time and delayed arrival rates for each airline."
